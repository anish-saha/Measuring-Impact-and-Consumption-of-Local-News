The value of impactful, award-winning journalism cannot be understated in terms of how it greatly shapes the public's perception of various ongoing trends and events around the world. On a more local level, impactful journalism can highlight ongoing major injustices by various corporate or federal entities, bring major world events, crimes, or court cases to the public eye, and even influence economics and perception surrounding affluent people, major political figures, large organizations, and flawed systems. However, while such journalism is recognized with awards such as the Pulitzer Prize, there exists no way to linguistically distinguish what exactly characterizes these impactful works. Such capabilities would have major positive implications, such as creating more economically viable models for publishers, fostering a more productive culture in the field of journalism, and gaining a better understanding of the aspects of journalism that influence people the most.  

As such, in collaboration with the Stanford Graduate School of Business, our team's goal was to develop effective models to tackle the classification task of identifying "impactful" (award-winning) articles in a large dataset of millions of publications from newspaper and journals across the country collected over the past two decades.  Leveraging the baseline metadata, various metrics derived using text analysis, and features derived using Word2Vec clusters and BERT entity extraction, our goal is to develop a predictive model that is able to analyze the content of an article, common contemporary trends or entities, and other article metadata to output whether a given article is "impactful."
